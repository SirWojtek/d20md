Of course, to the victim no time passes at all, but each apparent round experienced by the phane ages the victim 1d4 years, at the same time healing the phane of 20 hit points of damage. A victim who is not somehow released from static time by a friend who can cast <i>dispel magic</i>,  <i>dispel magic, greater</i>,  or some other likely spell, eventually ages to death. Victims killed in this manner automatically fall out of static time as desiccated husks that disintegrate to a fine dust with even the lightest touch. Victims who are released prior to death immediately apply the physical effects of aging, but not the mental effects.</p>\n"

This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 150 feet, with a range increment of 30 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check (DC 38) or burst it with a Strength check (DC 44). Both are standard actions. Web-spinning spiders often create sheets of sticky webbing about 1,000 feet square. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed at a Spot check (DC 20) to notice a web; otherwise, they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 24 hit points, and sheet webs have damage reduction 20/fire. A devastation spider can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any creature caught in the web.</p>\n"

A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon\u2019s Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon\u2019s breath weapon)."

The elemental controls its exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. Gargantuan or smaller creatures might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 53) when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 4d8 points of damage. It must also succeed at a second Reflex save (DC 53) or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 4d8 points of damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save (DC 53) each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane. If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 53) to cast a spell. The DC is Strength-based.</p>\n"

Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.</p>\n"

In fact, a protean's form constantly boils, and it requires a move-equivalent action each round for a protean to maintain a certain shape (even if that shape is a combination of several shapes). Whatever its present form, the protean retains all its own special qualities. Plus, it gains the advantage of up to four extraordinary abilities from the forms it mimics (but not spell-like or supernatural powers). The assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no larger than 200 feet in its largest dimension (make sure to take into account rules for reach and size modifiers to AC and melee attacks). Incorporeal traits can also be assumed, which counts as a single extraordinary ability. If a hagunemnon assumes a partial form that confers an extraordinary ability already possessed by the creature, only the better of the two abilities is retained. No matter its form, the protean can never make more than five attacks using a full-round action. However, it may substitute a melee attack form for one of its slam attacks, using its own base attack bonus and Strength modifier to Damage, but dealing base Damage appropriate to the attack type.</p><p/>\n"

Using a standard action, the thorciasid makes a ranged touch attack against any foe it can see up to 60 feet away. If it succeeds at the ranged touch attack, the subject makes a grapple check against the cocoon. This is accomplished as if the thorciasid itself were making the grapple check with a competence bonus of +10, for a total check modifier of +37. On a failed check for the subject, the goo hardens into a partial cocoon, and the victim is treated as if grappled (even though the thorciasid is free to do as it desires). The subject can attempt to break the grapple of the cocoon (or use Escape Artist) each round, making an opposed grapple check against the cocoon (check modifier +37 for the cocoon). A thorciasid can reinforce a partial cocoon by spending a standard action secreting additional goo. Each action so spent provides an additional +5 to the cocoon's grapple check modifier. Visually, the victim becomes more and more covered and is finally com-pletely encased in a cocoon. Even fully encased victims can still breathe, and a thorciasid can drain a victim's life force at its leisure.</p>\n"

The save DC is Constitution-based.</p><p>An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried-armor, backpacks, even shirts-hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).</p><p>Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast.</p><p>A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Charisma check (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful.</p><p>Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to remove.

If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don\u2019t escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon\u2019s Strength bonus (round down)."

Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents). A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragon\u2019s body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon\u2019s breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don\u2019t escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon\u2019s Strength bonus (round down)."

Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon\u2019s breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don\u2019t escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon\u2019s Strength bonus (round down)."

The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon\u2019s space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon\u2019s Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon\u2019s breath weapon)."

In this form, the elemental can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.</p><p>The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and up to 50 feet tall, depending on the elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.</p><p>The elemental's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature's space.</p><p>Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (see the table below for details) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the whirlwind's effects varies with the elemental's size (see the table). The save DC is Strength based.</p><p>Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind.</p><p>Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.</p><p>If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.

In vortex form, the elemental can move through the water or along the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the elemental's size. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.</p><p>The elemental's movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature's space.</p><p>Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the vortex (see the table below for details) and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the vortex or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking damage each round. An affected creature is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the vortex's effects varies with the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based.</p><p>Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume.</p><p>The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.</p><p>If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment.</p><p>Those caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.</p><p>An elemental in vortex form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it.</p><p>Skills: A water elemental has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</p><table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" frame=\"VOID\" rules=\"ROWS\">\n\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"2\">\n<td colspan=\"6\"><b>Water Elemental Sizes</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"5\">\n<td/>\n<td/>\n<td/>\n<td colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"7\">\n<td><b>Elemental</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Height</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Weight</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Save DC</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Damage</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Height</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"7\">\n<td>Small<br/></td>\n<td>4 ft.<br/></td>\n<td>34 lb.<br/></td>\n<td>13<br/></td>\n<td>1d4<br/></td>\n<td>10-20 ft.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"7\">\n<td>Medium<br/></td>\n<td>8 ft.<br/></td>\n<td>280 lb.<br/></td>\n<td>15<br/></td>\n<td>1d6<br/></td>\n<td>10-30 ft.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"7\">\n<td>Large<br/></td>\n<td>16 ft.<br/></td>\n<td>2,250 lb.<br/></td>\n<td>19<br/></td>\n<td>2d6<br/></td>\n<td>10-40 ft.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"7\">\n<td>Huge<br/></td>\n<td>32 ft.<br/></td>\n<td>18,000 lb.<br/></td>\n<td>25<br/></td>\n<td>2d8<br/></td>\n<td>10-50 ft.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"7\">\n<td>Greater<br/></td>\n<td>36 ft.<br/></td>\n<td>21,000 lb.<br/></td>\n<td>28<br/></td>\n<td>2d8<br/></td>\n<td>10-60 ft.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol=\"7\" curcol=\"7\">\n<td>Elder<br/></td>\n<td>40 ft.<br/></td>\n<td>24,000 lb.<br/></td>\n<td>31<br/></td>\n<td>2d8<br/></td>\n<td>10-60 ft.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p/>\n"

When a harpy sings, all creatures (other than harpies) within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become captivated. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same harpy's song for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p><p>A captivated victim walks toward the harpy, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. (Thus, a fighter cannot run away or attack but takes no defensive penalties.) A victim within 5 feet of the harpy stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. A bard's countersong ability allows the captivated creature to attempt a new Will save.</p>\n<p> Will DC 17 negates.</p><p><i>Possessions: +3 studded leather</i>,  <i>+1 frost composite longbow</i> (+1 Str bonus), 10 cold iron arrows, 10 silvered arrows, 5 <i>+2 arrows</i>,  <i>lesser</i> <i>bracers of archery</i>,  <i>potion of cure moderate</i> <i>wounds</i>,  <i>potion of cat's grace</i>,  <i>cloak of resistance</i> <i>+2</i>,  <i>ring of protection +1</i>.

If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using <i>dominate monster</i> on the victim. The hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour they inhabit a body. A body reduced to Constitution 0 is dead.</p><p>A hellwasp-inhabited creature is relatively easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of insects inside. The swarm is intelligent enough to attempt to hide beneath loose clothing or a large cloak to keep its presence from being detected. The swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host.</p><p>A <i>remove disease</i> or <i>heal</i> spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.</p>\n"
